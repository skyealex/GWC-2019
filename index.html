        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Varsity Rowing!</b> I currently row with the Varsity Row New York (RNY) Queens team. My boathouse is a wonderful, strong, and hardworking community.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Tech Interning at BPL Central</b> I was one of 10 graduates from the T4 (Today's Teens, Tomorrow's Techies) to be offered the opportunity to take the next step in the program and become a Summer Ambassador. I elected to move locations to the Central Branch of the Brooklyn Public Library System to be exposed to a wider range of experiences than could be offered in Park Slope (a considerably smaller branch). The extended hours of Central also allowed me to fortunately engage with both my Girls Who Code program and my BPL internship.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Novice Rowing!</b> My introduction to rowing in <i>September 2018</i> sparked my love for crew and began a year-long preparation for Varsity training full of learning, ripe with exhaustation, and infused with the steady development of power.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Tech Assistant at BPL Park Slope</b>I began training for this position <i>Summer 2018</i> and continued to learn under the TRS (Tecnology Resource Specialist) at my neigborhood public library through June 2019, after which I was one of few selected for a subsequent internship to allow me to give back to my community using the skills I developed through the T4 (Today's Teens, Tomorrow's Techies) program.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Martial Arts:</b> I've been practicing AmeriKick style Karate in Brooklyn for <i>11 years now!</i> I have 2 black belts and was employed as an instructor (Sensei) at my dojo during <i>Summer 2018</i>.

          <p class=section>My friend Dayra is absolutely terrified of butterflies but I've loved them for a long time. This butterfly is named <b>Daniel</b>, he was born out of my Christmas tree in 2014 and lived well into February of 2015. <br><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/07/nyregion/an-uninvited-guest-treated-like-a-monarch-gets-the-spa-treatment.html">Here is an article about him!</a></p>
